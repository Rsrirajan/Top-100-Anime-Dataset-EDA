Anime are Japanese animated cartoon shows. I am trying to code an anime forum for a specific anime as a fun side-project, and this project allowed me to experiment with which one would be the best choice based on popularity. The dataset contains ratings and votes grouped by the anime name and the score (from 1-10). After importing the data frame, I first grouped it by anime name and summed all the values in the dataset, rendering the score column meaningless in the new data frame and multiplying the popularity ranking column by 10. I used this new data frame (name_grouping) to find the most overall voted anime, which was </span><span class="c0">Shingeki no Kyojin </span><span class="c1">(Attack on Titan) with 2260568 votes. This surprised me because this anime was so famous that over 2 million people went to this site to vote on it. I then used name_grouping to create a scatterplot with the x-axis as the popularity ranking and the y-axis as the total votes. The scatterplot (Figure 1) unsurprisingly showed a correlation between a lower amount of votes and lower popularity, but the correlation surprisingly didn&rsquo;t seem very linear and looked more like an exponentially decreasing function. I then randomly sampled 40 points from name_grouping and created another scatterplot (Figure 2) with the same variables, and while a linear relationship was more apparent, it still looked like an exponentially decreasing function to me. I then found the correlation coefficient between votes and the popularity ranking in name_grouping, which was about -0.873, indicating that there was a strong decreasing linear correlation between the two. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I then created a new data frame called mean_set that grouped the dataset by name but now took the mean of all those values. This was done in order to give meaning to the popularity ranking and favorites count columns, and subsequently, the most favorited and popular anime were found to be </span><span class="c0">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">Death Note</span><span>, respectively. </span><span class="c0">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood </span><span class="c1">was favorited 190243 times and was 3rd in popularity. It should also be noted that many of the anime titles had no values in the favorites count column.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I also created a data frame of all anime that I hadn&rsquo;t watched yet from the 100 anime in the dataset, and randomly picked one to watch next, which was </span><span class="c0">Deadman Wonderland</span><span>. I still haven&rsquo;t decided on what anime to create a forum for, but I have narrowed the options down to </span><span class="c0">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">One Piece</span><span>&nbsp;(my personal favorite), and </span><span class="c0">Attack on Titan</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I found the mean and standard deviations of the Votes column of the name_grouping data frame and thought that the true votes weren&rsquo;t reflected accurately based on each show because separate seasons of the same show have different rankings in the dataset. Because it is too difficult to group the shows&rsquo; season&rsquo;s together even using regular expressions (some are called &lsquo;Season 2&rsquo;, &lsquo;2&rsquo;, &lsquo;II&rsquo;, etc.), I decided to conduct a 1 sample z test. My hypothesis was that the true mean of votes amongst the shows was higher than the calculated mean of 96419.5, and I used a random sample of 33 anime from name_grouping to roughly represent every show without any deviations due to seasons. I used a significance level of 0.05. I calculated the sample mean, subtracted it from the expected value, and divided that result by the standard error (found by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size) to get the z-score. I then found the appropriate p-value by finding the portion to the right of the z-score on a normal distribution which was 0. Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and there is evidence that the true mean of anime votes is greater than the mean of name_grouping&rsquo;s Votes column.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Finally, I used linear regression to create predictions of votes using extrapolation and found the mean absolute error of predicted votes vs the actual votes. I made a linear regression model and created a fit using the Popularity_ranking column (of name_grouping) as the independent variable and Votes as the dependent. I then made an extrapolated prediction of the total votes the 101st most popular anime would have. This prediction was likely not valid because it was extrapolated. I decided to find the mean absolute value error between predicted votes made by the model and created a new column in name_grouping called Predicted_votes. I took the absolute value of the differences between the Votes and Predicted_votes columns and stored that in a new column called error, and taking the mean of the error column returned the mean absolute value error, which was about 121072. This means that the error between the predictions and the actual votes was very high, and the extrapolated data point was likely far from being accurate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Figure 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 473.50px; height: 357.94px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 473.50px; height: 366.52px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -8.58px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Figure 2)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 460.50px; height: 353.63px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 468.31px; height: 359.91px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -6.27px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></body></html>
